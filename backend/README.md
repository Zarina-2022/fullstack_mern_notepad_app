# BACKEND

**Project Description:**

This backend project built using Node.js and Express.js framework for creating RESTful APIs. The project enables users to manage notes, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting notes from a MongoDB database.

**Key Components:**

1. **Express Setup:** The project initializes an Express application to handle HTTP requests.

2. **Middleware Configuration:** Express middleware is configured to handle JSON data parsing and logging of incoming requests.

3. **Routes:** The project defines routes for managing notes, including CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete). These routes are modularized using Express Router for better organization.

4. **Database Connection:** The project establishes a connection to a MongoDB database using Mongoose, an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

5. **Note Model:** A Mongoose schema is defined to structure the data for notes, consisting of a title and a description. This schema is then exported as a Mongoose model for CRUD operations.

6. **Controller Functions:** Controller functions are defined for handling various operations on notes, including creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting notes. These functions interact with the Mongoose model to perform database operations.

**Dependencies:**

- `express`: A minimalist web framework for Node.js, used for building web applications and APIs.
- `dotenv`: A module for loading environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.
- `mongoose`: An ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js, used for modeling application data and interacting with MongoDB databases.

**Scripts:**

- A script is configured to run the server using Nodemon, a utility that monitors changes in the source code and automatically restarts the server.

**Overall Functionality:**

Upon starting the server, it connects to the MongoDB database using the provided URI from the environment variables. Users can then send HTTP requests to interact with the API endpoints for managing notes. The API supports operations such as creating a new note, fetching all notes, retrieving a single note by its ID, updating a note, and deleting a note.

Each API endpoint is handled by a corresponding controller function, which interacts with the MongoDB database through the Mongoose model. Responses are sent back to the client with appropriate status codes and data, allowing users to effectively manage their notes through the provided API.
